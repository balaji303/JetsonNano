-> Steps involved in classification
 Collect Data -> Train Model -> Live Demostration

-> PyTorch is the Framework we used

-> For our projects, we modified the last layer of a pre-trained ResNet-18 model. The last layer is a Fully connected Layer

-> We used PyTorch provided pre-trained ResNet-18 architecture. ImageNet was the dataset ResNet-18 pre trained on.

-> Adam is the optimizer used for training the model
